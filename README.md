## Overview

**Answery** is a Chrome extension that lets you select any region of your screen, capture it, and instantly send it to an AI model for analysis. Whether it's a math problem, a chart, a code snippet, or a question on a webpage — just select the area and get your answer in seconds.

It also features a **Form Solver** that can automatically scrape and solve text-based multiple choice questions. Currently supporting Microsoft Forms only.

Answery is designed to be fast, minimal, and unobtrusive.

## Features

- **🖼️ Area Capture** — Select any rectangular region on any webpage to capture and analyze.
- **🤖 AI-Powered Analysis** — Powered by Google Gemini vision models (3 Pro, 3 Flash, 2.5 Pro, 2.5 Flash, 2.5 Flash Lite).
- **📝 Form Solver** — Automatically scrape and solve text-based multiple choice questions. Optionally auto-select the correct answers on the page.
- **⚡ Quick Capture Button** — A draggable floating button on every page for instant one-click capture.
- **🥷 Stealth Mode** — Results appear nearly invisible and are only revealed on hover. Capture is triggered via keyboard shortcut only — no visible UI.
- **📌 In-App Results** — Option to display AI responses directly inside the extension popup instead of as a floating overlay on the page.
- **⏱️ Auto-Dismiss Timer** — Response popups automatically close after a configurable duration, with a pause button to keep them visible.
- **⌨️ Keyboard Shortcut** — Press `⌘+Shift+Y` (or  `Ctrl+Shift+Y` on Windows) to start a capture without opening the extension popup.
- **🎨 Custom Instructions** — Set a default prompt to guide how the AI analyzes every capture.
- **🔒 Local Storage** — Your API key and settings are stored locally in the browser. Nothing is sent to external servers except the image data to the Gemini API.

## Installation

### From Source (Developer Mode)

1. **Clone** this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SKEGGIA27/Answery.git
   ```

2. Open **Google Chrome** and navigate to:
   ```
   chrome://extensions
   ```

3. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in the top-right corner).

4. Click **"Load unpacked"** and select the cloned `Answery` folder.

5. The Answery icon will appear in your browser toolbar. Click it to get started.

### Gemini API Key Setup

Answery requires a **Google Gemini API key** to function:

1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) and create a free API key.
2. Open the Answery popup, expand **Settings**, and paste your key in the **API Key** field.
3. Your key is saved locally and is never shared with anyone other than Google's API.

### Updating the Extension

When a new version is available, you can update without losing any of your saved data (API key, settings). 

**Method A: If you installed Answery via Git Clone (Recommended)**
1. Open a terminal inside your existing `Answery` folder.
2. Run `git pull` to download the latest changes.

**Method B: If you installed Answery via Source Code (ZIP)**
1. Download and extract the new source code ZIP.
2. **Overwrite** the files inside your existing `Answery` folder with the new ones. Do *not* delete the old folder or move it to a different location.

**Final Step (Both Methods):**
Go to `chrome://extensions` and click the **Reload** (refresh) icon on the Answery card. Chrome will load the new code while keeping all your data intact.

</p>

### Quick Capture Button

Enable **"Quick Capture Button"** in Settings to show a floating, draggable button on every webpage. Click it to instantly start a capture without opening the extension.

<p align="center">
  <img src="screenshots/quick-capture-button.png" alt="Quick Capture Button" width="300">
</p>

### Keyboard Shortcut

Press **`Ctrl+Shift+Y`** (Windows/Linux) or **`⌘+Shift+Y`** (Mac) to start a capture directly.

### Stealth Mode

Enable **"Stealth Mode"** in Settings for a completely discrete experience:
- The floating button is hidden.
- Capture is only triggered via keyboard shortcut.
- The response popup appears nearly transparent and only becomes fully visible when you hover over it.
- Adjust the **Popup Transparency** slider to control how invisible the response appears.
- For a full discrete experience, combine stealth mode with the **In-App Results only** switch to display the response in the extension UI instead of as a floating overlay on the page.

<table>
<tr>
<td align="center">
  <img src="screenshots/stealth-mode.png" alt="Stealth Mode" width="300"><br>
  <em>Stealth Mode with popup transparency set to 80%. Hovering over the popup reveals it fully. Increase the percentage to make it even less visible.</em>
</td>
<td align="center">
  <img src="screenshots/stealth-mode-inapp.png" alt="Stealth Mode In-App Results" width="300"><br>
  <em>Stealth Mode with "In-App Results Only" enabled — the response is shown inside the extension popup, with no floating overlay on the page.</em>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

> **<img src="screenshots/notification.png" width="20" style="vertical-align: middle;"> Tip:** When **"In-App Results Only"** is enabled, a red notification badge will appear on the Answery extension icon to let you know that a response is ready. Simply open the extension to view it.

### Form Solver (Microsoft Forms only)

1. Navigate to any **Microsoft Forms** quiz page.
2. Open Answery — a **"Solve Form"** button will appear automatically.
3. Click **"Solve Form"** — the extension scrapes all text-based multiple choice questions and sends them to the AI.
4. Answers are displayed in the popup or as a floating overlay on the page (depending on the **In-App Results Only** setting).
5. **Optional:** Enable the **"Auto-select answers (beta)"** toggle to have the extension automatically click the correct options on the form.

> **Note:** Questions containing images are automatically skipped.

## Prompt Examples

Customize the **"Custom Instructions"** field to tailor how the AI responds. Here are some ideas:

| Use Case | Prompt Example |
|---|---|
| **Homework / Quizzes** | `Tell me the correct answer and briefly explain why.` |
| **Code Analysis** | `Explain what this code does and identify any bugs.` |
| **Translation** | `Translate all the text in this image to English.` |
| **Math Problems** | `Solve this math problem step by step and give me the final answer.` |
| **Summarization** | `Summarize the content visible in this image in 2-3 sentences.` |
| **Proofreading** | `Check this text for grammar or spelling errors and suggest corrections.` |

> **Note:** If no custom instruction is set, the default prompt is: *"Analyze the image and return ONLY the text of the correct options. No greetings, no explanations. If there are multiple correct answers, separate them with commas."*
