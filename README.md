## Overview

**Answery** is a Chrome extension that lets you select any region of your screen, capture it, and instantly send it to an AI model for analysis. Whether it's a math problem, a chart, a code snippet, or a question on a webpage — just select the area and get your answer in seconds.

It also features a **Form Solver** that can automatically scrape and solve text-based multiple choice questions. Currently supporting Microsoft Forms only.

Answery is designed to be fast, minimal, and unobtrusive.

## Features

- **🖼️ Area Capture** — Select any rectangular region on any webpage to capture and analyze.
- **🤖 AI-Powered Analysis** — Powered by Google Gemini vision models (3 Pro, 3 Flash, 2.5 Pro, 2.5 Flash, 2.5 Flash Lite).
- **📝 Form Solver** — Automatically scrape and solve text-based multiple choice questions. Optionally auto-select the correct answers on the page.
- **⚡ Quick Capture Button** — A draggable floating button on every page for instant one-click capture.
- **🥷 Stealth Mode** — Results appear nearly invisible and are only revealed on hover. Capture is triggered via keyboard shortcut only — no visible UI.
- **📌 In-App Results** — Option to display AI responses directly inside the extension popup instead of as a floating overlay on the page.
- **⏱️ Auto-Dismiss Timer** — Response popups automatically close after a configurable duration, with a pause button to keep them visible.
- **⌨️ Keyboard Shortcut** — Press `⌘+Shift+Y` (or  `Ctrl+Shift+Y` on Windows) to start a capture without opening the extension popup.
- **🎨 Custom Instructions** — Set a default prompt to guide how the AI analyzes every capture.
- **🔒 Local Storage** — Your API key and settings are stored locally in the browser. Nothing is sent to external servers except the image data to the Gemini API.

## How to Use

### Basic Capture

1. Click the **Answery icon** in the toolbar to open the popup.
2. Click **"Capture Area"**.
3. Draw a rectangle around the area you want to analyze.
4. Confirm the selection with the **✔** button (or cancel with **✖**).
5. Wait for the AI response to appear as a floating popup on the page or in the extension UI.

### Quick Capture Button

Enable **"Quick Capture Button"** in Settings to show a floating, draggable button on every webpage. Click it to instantly start a capture without opening the extension.

### Keyboard Shortcut

Press **`Ctrl+Shift+Y`** (Windows/Linux) or **`⌘+Shift+Y`** (Mac) to start a capture directly.

### Stealth Mode

Enable **"Stealth Mode"** in Settings for a completely discrete experience:
- The floating button is hidden.
- Capture is only triggered via keyboard shortcut.
- The response popup appears nearly transparent and only becomes fully visible when you hover over it.
- Adjust the **Popup Transparency** slider to control how invisible the response appears.
- For a full discrete experience, combine stealth mode with the **In-App Results only** switch to display the response in the extension UI instead of as a floating overlay on the page.

### Form Solver (Microsoft Forms only)

1. Navigate to any **Microsoft Forms** quiz page.
2. Open the Answery popup — a **"Solve Form"** button will appear automatically.
3. Click **"Solve Form"** — the extension scrapes all text-based multiple choice questions and sends them to the AI.
4. Answers are displayed in the popup or as a floating overlay on the page (depending on the **In-App Results Only** setting).
5. **Optional:** Enable the **"Auto-select answers (beta)"** toggle to have the extension automatically click the correct options on the form.

> **Note:** Questions containing images are automatically skipped.

## Prompt Examples

Customize the **"Custom Instructions"** field to tailor how the AI responds. Here are some ideas:

| Use Case | Prompt Example |
|---|---|
| **Homework / Quizzes** | `Tell me the correct answer and briefly explain why.` |
| **Code Analysis** | `Explain what this code does and identify any bugs.` |
| **Translation** | `Translate all the text in this image to English.` |
| **Math Problems** | `Solve this math problem step by step and give me the final answer.` |
| **Summarization** | `Summarize the content visible in this image in 2-3 sentences.` |
| **Proofreading** | `Check this text for grammar or spelling errors and suggest corrections.` |

> **Note:** If no custom instruction is set, the default prompt is: *"Analyze the content in this image and provide a clear answer."*
